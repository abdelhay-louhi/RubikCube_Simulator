( or Rubik's Cube Move Counter)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Rubik's Cube Move Counter, This program helps you determine the number of moves needed to return a Rubik's Cube to its original state after performing a sequence of moves. This process is more efficient than attempting to achieve the same result manually.

## Motivation

The Rubik's Cube is a classic puzzle that involves arranging the cube's faces so that each side is a single color. It's well-known that performing the same move four times in a row brings the cube back to its initial state. However, the question arises: what if you perform two different moves in succession? How many moves are needed to restore the cube to its initial state? While one way to find the answer is through mathematical calculations, and it's not for everyone. The alternative is to physically execute the moves on the cube until it returns to its original state. Unfortunately, this manual approach is impractical, requiring you to remember and track each position and color change. So Here, rubik_cube_counter application cames to fix that problem.

## Color Mapping

For simplicity, the following color mapping is used:

- White: 1
- Yellow: 2
- Blue: 3
- Green: 4
- Orange: 5
- Red: 6
